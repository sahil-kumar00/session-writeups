session started with an introduction to ip addresses. ip defines the address of a device on a network.
all the subsquent things were shown while performing the rootme room of tryhackme
we are taught about the nmap command and how it can be used to check what type of requests are allowed by some server.
after that we thought how we can check the directories on a server and for that we used gobuster.
we got some directories and the one we checked was panel. it was asking us to upload some file which means it file upload vulnerability time yay.
after hit and trial we got that we can upload php5 files and the server will execute it.
we then uploaded reverse shell script by pentest monkey to the server and obtained the reverse shell.
after that it was all basic linux stuff
